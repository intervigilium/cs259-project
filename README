UCLA Winter 2011
Project

This project is a high level description of an accelerator designed to
accelerate several medical imaging applications. In particular, the
functions to be accelerated include a rician deconvolution, gaussian blur,
two-phase 3d operations for segmentation and EM-TV operations for compressive
sensing.
Rician Deconvolution accelerator functions can be shared between denoise and
deblur imaging applications, and gaussian blur accelerator functions can be
shared between deblur and registration imaging applications.
